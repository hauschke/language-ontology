# Language Ontology

***Early DRAFT***

This is draft work, an effort to create an OBO-compliant, BFO-based, reusable,
maintained ontology based on ISO-639.  The ontology represents each language in
ISO-639-3, ISO-639-2, and ISO-639-1 as a class.

If successful, we hope to register the work as
[http://obofoundry.org/ontology/lang](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/lang)

For background regarding this work, see [Early Thoughts on Representing
Languages and Language Capabilities](http://bit.ly/2RPYrY4)

The [src/ontology/templates](src/ontology/templates) directory contains data from the ISO 639 registration authorities used to make templates for the OBO robot tool.

The [src/ontology/i18n](src/ontology/i18n) directory contains assertions for adding definitions and labels in additional languages to the Language Ontology.

## Versions
